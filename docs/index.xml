  the specific website address and twitter handle have been edited
  perhaps some CSS to format&amp;hellip;
  In splitting out the shortcode call to multiple lines in this content, the resulting tweet has some extra whitespace. Initial way to solve would be to put the call on one line again, probably.</description>

      <description>The shortcode used in this blog about Hugo uses font awesome to provide the github icon.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can use a feather icon for github. For the moment, we&amp;rsquo;ll add it after the fontawesome icon, so we could get both!
The second parameter is a comment that is added to the end of the link.
Shortcodes can be used to insert HTML etc into the content.

      <description>Create Article Preview in Hugo
From Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s article  After building this functionality I realized I could create a short code to do a similar thing with relative page links. I created a short code named relativelink.html, in which the .Site.GetPage allows me to fetch a page based on its URL. I then extract the title, image, and description to create my preview. The thumbnail generation produces a slightly wider image and constrains the height as well.</description>

      <description>Work through an interesting item on the Hugo forum about &lt;strong&gt;Featured Image&lt;/strong&gt; to see what can be understood and applied if possible. This is also the first use of summary in front matter to override the default of first 70 words in the post, and should be seen in the single template at the bottom of the page. The template single.html has been left updated with the ability to display the featured_image. Not sure how this relates to page bundles yet, but it will be useful for existing posts. And, still confused about relative links for images.
&lt;strong&gt;Note that summary can contain Markdown&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

Initial setup limits images to 640 px width Create this file: layouts/render-image.html
{{ $image := (.Page.Resources.GetMatch .Destination).Resize &amp;#34;640x&amp;#34; }} &amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;{{ $image.RelPermalink | safeURL }}&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; Carried out.
The optimisation only works on bundles.
Looked at Page Info then media for the images, and there were hopeful messages about reduced size, so need to disable the change and inspect before and after.</description>

      <description>Looking for tutorials on building hugo sites from scratch, and in particular anything that helps to understand the vagaries of leaf bundle, branch bundle and page bundle.
This youtube video is actually about setting up a theme but the idea is to have a working hugo site with some leaf and branch bundles as a working system to examine. The github here contains a starting point from which a site HUGO-BUNDLE-1 without a theme has been constructed.</description>

      <description>First go at trying to represent the relationship between the &amp;ldquo;elements&amp;rdquo; of this web site.
HUGO converts the INPUTS into OUTPUTS Hugo generation uses the &amp;ldquo;elements&amp;rdquo; to convert the content into the web site (HTML, CSS).
DIAGRAM Difficult to draw, but HOME, LIST, SINGLE and TERMS are the starting point, the templates.
These templates in turn cause the baseof template to be used, and partials to be included.</description>

      <description>the problem In hugo-scratch-1, using the markdown for blockquote, which is:
&amp;gt; followed by space at the start of a line
there was no formatting of any kind.
what html is hugo generating? Understanding what HTML is generated is the starting point, so a simple View Page Source shows that BLOCKQUOTE start and end tags are being generated. So either the default CSS or the generated CSS is not set up for BLOCKQUOTE.</description>

      <description>The problem Trying to follow the documentation and forum on how to get an image to display did not seem to work, because there is an assumption about how the generated website is laid out. The original objective was to find a few shortcodes as well as vanilla markdown to see if a responsive image could be displayed with captions, etc.
The image test.png (2408 x 968) in static was used as input to a number of shortcodes etc, but to no avail, because the structure of the generated website was not taken into account.</description>

When the markdown is pasted in, there are no line breaks so all the links run together. At the moment, the simple solution is to add an asterisk space at the front of each line.

      <description>Simple Shortcode To add raw html
This is raw HTML, inside Markdown. And here is a feather icon!!! 
And the Rating, which could be set up as separate hard coded short codes, so star-1, star-2, etc. There must be a way to input the number of stars as a variable.

See the markdown for how this works. Basically wrap the target text in the pair of highlight tags.

 Favicon is a 16 x 16 pixel image. It goes in the static folder. favicon.io was used to make a DM logo from text. This didn&amp;rsquo;t work for ages but the answer seemed to be to make an absolute reference as per hugo-scratch-1   {{/* The favicon works as a relative link for the index.html at root */}} {{/* but not for any other link on the menu or any content at a lower level */}} {{/* that&#39;s why the absURL is used */}} {{/* &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;shortcut icon&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;favicon.</description>

 It may be worth an experiment! Using the no theme setup, move the posts into there. At least with the simplified approach things can be tried out.

      <description>The Journal Theme looks good, but there is more opportunity to learn about Hugo by evolving hugo-scratch-1 and seeing how easy it is to copy markdown entries between setups. The Journal Theme is like all the themes seen so far, at an advanced level that makes understanding it an impossible challenge at the moment. But it is useful to have it there as a reference as the understanding increases. For example, the front matter parameter cover results in an image being displayed at the top of the post.</description>

      <description>I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree. A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast; A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray; A tree that may in Summer wear A nest of robins in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain. Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.</description>

      <description>If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!</description>

      <description>node.js Updated this from 12.18.2 to 15.1.0 by installing the latest version from the nodejs website.
Visual Studio Code websites: react-fullstack-course
create-react-app used to create the base files etc
npm start used to start up the local server on localhost:3000
 Coded along with the React Basics section until styling. This is a big course, and it is worth coming back to. Will take a look at the last section about ES6 because there are videos about templates which may be relevant.</description>

      <description>Watch the video   Watched Brad Traversy&amp;rsquo;s Youtube video. Build a Responsive Website | HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox &amp;amp; More
  A CSS framework like Bootstrap is not used. Instead, CSS is used in two ways. As utility classes, used as part of HTML, as per CSS frameworks, and in the usual way to target specific HTML. The CSS resulting is quite long though.
  Netlify is used to deploy to a live website, and as well as github (used previously but not this time) a project folder can be dragged in to netlify.</description>

      <description>Getting the hugo terminal site visible on the home network From RED, tried to access the running hugo server with &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;http://192.168.1.137:1313 but got &amp;ldquo;this site can&amp;rsquo;t be reached&amp;rdquo;. Tried disabling Linux Mint firewall (no firewall on RED).
With no change, decided to do a &amp;ldquo;hugo&amp;rdquo; to build the pages and use another web server to supply them.
Once the pages are built, they can be copied to the apache2 folder. Note that this does not clear the folder out first.</description>
