      <description>the problem In hugo-scratch-1, using the markdown for blockquote, which is:
&amp;gt; followed by space at the start of a line
there was no formatting of any kind.
what html is hugo generating? Understanding what HTML is generated is the starting point, so a simple View Page Source shows that BLOCKQUOTE start and end tags are being generated. So either the default CSS or the generated CSS is not set up for BLOCKQUOTE.</description>

  A CSS framework like Bootstrap is not used. Instead, CSS is used in two ways. As utility classes, used as part of HTML, as per CSS frameworks, and in the usual way to target specific HTML. The CSS resulting is quite long though.
  Netlify is used to deploy to a live website, and as well as github (used previously but not this time) a project folder can be dragged in to netlify.</description>
