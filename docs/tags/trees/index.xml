      <description>I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree. A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast; A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray; A tree that may in Summer wear A nest of robins in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain. Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.</description>
