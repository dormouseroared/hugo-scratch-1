      <description>First go at trying to represent the relationship between the &amp;ldquo;elements&amp;rdquo; of this web site.
HUGO converts the INPUTS into OUTPUTS Hugo generation uses the &amp;ldquo;elements&amp;rdquo; to convert the content into the web site (HTML, CSS).
DIAGRAM Difficult to draw, but HOME, LIST, SINGLE and TERMS are the starting point, the templates.
These templates in turn cause the baseof template to be used, and partials to be included.</description>

      <description>The problem Trying to follow the documentation and forum on how to get an image to display did not seem to work, because there is an assumption about how the generated website is laid out. The original objective was to find a few shortcodes as well as vanilla markdown to see if a responsive image could be displayed with captions, etc.
The image test.png (2408 x 968) in static was used as input to a number of shortcodes etc, but to no avail, because the structure of the generated website was not taken into account.</description>

      <description>Some links to mermaidjs The topic is interesting because it will be useful to create the various diagrams. Initially, some links can be collected here, and mermaidjs explored.
mermaid js
Netlify Learn Theme â€¢ mermaidjs shortcode Looking for information about being able to make a diagram in Hugo using shortcodes, found this Learn Theme which has a Github repository with shortcodes, including mermaid.
There would be a link to the javascript, and a shortcode to set up, but here is an example of the shortcode being used to make a diagram.</description>
