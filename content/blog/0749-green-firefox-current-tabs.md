## Record what was going on, and a chance to organise and review
Note that pinned tabs have been removed.

When the markdown is pasted in, there are no line breaks so all the links run together. At the moment, the simple solution is to add an asterisk space at the front of each line. 

The best way to do this with Visual Studio Code is to: 
* select the lines to be updated
* Press SHIFT + ALT + I to insert multiple cursors at the end of each line.
* Press Home twice to jump to the start of every line.
* Add the asterisk space to the selected lines.

Update:
* Paste it in
* Ctrl+B to hide Explorer window and reduce impact of * applied to lines that wrap. Will have to look at a better way of doing this.
* Alt+Shift+Down-Arrow to extend cursor down the start of each line. Try Alt-Z to toggle word wrap!
* Add the asterisk space to the start of each line
* Tidy up
## The family of Interpunct (·), Middle Dot (&middot;), Bullet Characters (&bull;)

Noticed on one of the links there was a "raised" full stop and found this article on the [Interpunct on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct) which also has some helpful instructions on how to find it on the keyboard for various operating systems. For Linux it is AltGr+full-stop (·). 

This character can be used a bit like the vertical line to divide up a heading etc. 

The character in the heading above was created by Unicode entry: Ctrl-Shift-U then 00b7 and Enter.

There are a few similar character entities also available: &middot; &bull; &compfn; &sdot;
