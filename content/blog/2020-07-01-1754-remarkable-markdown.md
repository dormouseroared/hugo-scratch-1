# Remarkable

Experimenting with this yay installed app, and a dropbox folder called Journal. Start with local Documents/Journal and create files with format yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm.md and then upload.

Or with the yay dropbox app installed in the computer, the files can be edited in situ, as the dropbox folders are replicated.
