> Coded along with the React Basics section until styling. This is a big course, and it is worth coming back to. Will take a look at the last section about ES6 because there are videos about templates which may be relevant.

> As for REACT, it is probably not an option at the moment for real use, but as a way to understand Javascript it is excellent. May also be worth trying out ANGULAR and VUE as alternative ways to explore.

> The Javascript ES6 section is very good.
