Running on Green, in the folder Websites and on github and github pages.

Following the zwbetz tutorial again, from scratch, but this time:
* favicon
* baseURL
* html templates inline rather than baseof, partials, etc
* comments in the templates (more to be done)
* other experiments including bootstrap classes etc to try out formatting and other ideas
* use of Meld to compare the inline html for index, single, list and terms has been carried out to allow easier highlight of the key differences
