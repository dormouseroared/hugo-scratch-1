* [Regis Philibert &bull; Hugo Page Resources and how to use them](https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2018/01/hugo-page-resources-and-how-to-use-them/)
* front matter only contains manually added title and date but nothing else yet
* some random images have now been placed in the first folder, and displayed using new Resources template code in single.html that should work for all pages
* also added testbundle to the menu, and it can be changed later
> Is there a hugo new command to generate new content (including Front Matter) in Page Resource format, including an Archetype, or does everything have to be added manually?
