* [The Coding Train | Git and Github for Poets | Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)
* This is a very easy to watch 11 video set playlist, which led to looking for a way to get the thumbnail for the first video on the playlist.
* Searched for "youtube thumbnail grab" and found [Get YouTube Thumbnail](https://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com/)
* which returns images and links when the youtube link is entered,for large and small thumbnails.
* these two are shown below:
