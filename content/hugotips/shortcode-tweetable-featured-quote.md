* [Brian Li &bull; adding a tweetable featured quote shortcode to a hugo site](https://brianli.com/2020/07/adding-a-tweetable-featured-quote-shortcode-to-a-hugo-site/)
* [Brian Li &bull; more Hugo blogs](https://brianli.com/tag/hugo/)

* the specific website address and twitter handle have been edited
* perhaps some CSS to format...
* In splitting out the shortcode call to multiple lines in this content, the resulting tweet has some extra whitespace. Initial way to solve would be to put the call on one line again, probably.
* this is a great shortcode to investigate and understand
* but not ready for production until it is understood
