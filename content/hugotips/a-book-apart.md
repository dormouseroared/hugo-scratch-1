[^1]: Firefox extension LinkGopher used to create a list of weblinks on [A Book Apart | Books](https://abookapart.com/collections/books) then into Visual Studio Code cursor selection, add the Markdown to the start and end of each line, and then manually enter the details for each book. Some manual edit of longer lines that wrapped over the line to remove incorrect stuff. Maybe get rid of Explorer next time. Could not find an automated way to create this Markdown.
